# AudioCanvas-Generative-AI

Full stack web application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo LLM and DALL-E model to translate sound to text to an image.

Made with React, Django, and PostgreSQL.

Make sure to turn on the sound before you watch the demo.

Fun fact:

- In the making of this project in the month of July, $2.28 was spent on OpenAI API calls.
- The caching feature saves processing time AND money because it pulls the image from the cache without using an API call.
    - It's kind of like dynamic programming.
